# Create Skill

Create exactly one new Cloud skill. Do not publish it to a marketplace and do not grant org-wide access in this flow.

## Fast path (prefer these exact MCP names)

Call \`openwork-cloud_execute_capability\` with these names. Skip broad search unless a call returns \`unknown_capability\`.

| Step | Capability | Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | \`postPlugins\` | body below |
| Verify | \`getPluginsResolved\` | path \`{ "pluginId": "<id>" }\` |

Optional pre-check only when a same-named skill may already exist: \`getConfigObjects\` with query \`{ "type": "skill", "q": "<skill-name>" }\`.

## Required skill format

Produce one complete \`SKILL.md\` with:

- opening and closing \`---\` frontmatter delimiters
- lowercase kebab-case \`name\` matching the intended skill name
- non-empty trigger-oriented \`description\`
- non-empty Markdown instruction body
- no secrets

## Workflow

1. Draft the complete \`SKILL.md\`.
2. Execute \`postPlugins\` with body:
   \`\`\`json
   {
     "name": "<plugin title>",
     "components": [
       { "type": "skill", "input": { "rawSourceText": "<complete SKILL.md>" } }
     ]
   }
   \`\`\`
   Do not send \`marketplaceId\` or \`orgWide\`.
3. Execute \`getPluginsResolved\` with the returned plugin id. Report plugin id, skill/config-object id, and that it is private until published or shared.
4. On authorization or validation errors, report them. Do not fall back to a workspace-local skill unless the user explicitly asks for one.

const ADD_TO_MARKETPLACE_SOURCE = `---
name: add-to-marketplace
description: |
  Add an existing Cloud plugin (or the plugin that owns a skill) to a marketplace.

  Triggers when user mentions:
  - "add this to marketplace"
  - "publish to marketplace"
  - "put this skill on the marketplace"
---

# Add To Marketplace

Attach one existing plugin to one marketplace. Do not create a new skill or plugin in this flow.

## Fast path (prefer these exact MCP names)

Call \`openwork-cloud_execute_capability\` with these names. Skip broad search unless a call returns \`unknown_capability\`.

| Step | Capability | Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List marketplaces | \`getMarketplaces\` | no path/body |
| Attach plugin | \`postMarketplacesPlugins\` | path + body below |
| Verify | \`getMarketplacesResolved\` | path \`{ "marketplaceId": "<id>" }\` |

## Interpret the target

Treat "this" / "this skill" / "this plugin" as:

1. the plugin or skill just created in the conversation, otherwise
2. the plugin/skill the user names, otherwise
3. ask which plugin and marketplace to use

A skill always lives inside a plugin. Marketplace membership is on the plugin id.

## Workflow

1. If \`marketplaceId\` is unknown, execute \`getMarketplaces\` and pick the named marketplace (ask when ambiguous).
2. Resolve \`pluginId\` from conversation context or ask. Do not recreate the plugin.
3. Execute \`postMarketplacesPlugins\` with:
   - path: \`{ "marketplaceId": "<id>" }\`
   - body: \`{ "pluginId": "<plugin id>" }\`
4. Execute \`getMarketplacesResolved\` and confirm the plugin is listed.
5. Stop. Do not grant user access unless the user asks for that separately.

const ADD_USER_TO_MARKETPLACE_SOURCE = `---
name: add-user-to-marketplace
description: |
  Grant a person access to a marketplace.

  Triggers when user mentions:
  - "add this user to the marketplace"
  - "give them marketplace access"
  - "share the marketplace with"
---

# Add User To Marketplace

Grant marketplace access to one member. Do not create plugins or attach plugins in this flow.

## Fast path (prefer these exact MCP names)

Call \`openwork-cloud_execute_capability\` with these names. Skip broad search unless a call returns \`unknown_capability\`.

| Step | Capability | Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List marketplaces | \`getMarketplaces\` | no path/body |
| Grant access | \`postMarketplacesAccess\` | path + body below |
| Verify | \`getMarketplacesAccess\` | path \`{ "marketplaceId": "<id>" }\` |

## Interpret the target

Treat "this user" / "them" as:

1. an \`orgMembershipId\` (\`om_…\`) already present in the conversation, otherwise
2. the person the user identifies — ask for their \`orgMembershipId\` if you only have a name/email and cannot resolve it from prior tool results, otherwise
3. ask who to grant and which marketplace

## Workflow

1. If \`marketplaceId\` is unknown, execute \`getMarketplaces\` and pick the named marketplace (ask when ambiguous).
2. Resolve \`orgMembershipId\`. Do not invent one.
3. Execute \`postMarketplacesAccess\` with:
   - path: \`{ "marketplaceId": "<id>" }\`
   - body: \`{ "orgMembershipId": "<om_…>", "role": "viewer" }\`
   Use \`"role": "manager"\` only when the user explicitly asks for manage access.
4. Execute \`getMarketplacesAccess\` and confirm the member is listed.
5. Stop. Do not change plugin membership unless asked.
