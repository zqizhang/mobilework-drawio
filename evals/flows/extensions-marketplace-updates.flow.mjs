/**
 * Extension Marketplace surface renders with the pending-update wiring.
 *
 * Signed-out baseline: the marketplace view must render its header, status
 * filters (including the "Updates" filter backed by pending cloud sync
 * changes), and the signed-out notice — without crashing on the new
 * pendingCloudPluginChanges store state.
 *
 * Cloud-gated update/badge assertions (Update / Update all / removed
 * upstream) require a Den org with a bumped plugin and are covered by the
 * markdown spec until eval cloud fixtures exist.
