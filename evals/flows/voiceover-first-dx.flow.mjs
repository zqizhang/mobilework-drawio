/**
 * Internal demo: demo-driven development demoing itself.
 *
 * Proves the voice-over-first DX end to end: the /voiceover entry point, the
 * "script before code" contract, the approved script as a checked-in artifact,
 * fresh worktree, scaffolding + drift detection, the fraimz PR comment, and the merge-blocking
 * exit-code contract. Runs app-less (requiresApp: false): the protagonist is a
 * developer in a terminal, so evidence is claims + assertions + real command
 * output instead of screenshots.
