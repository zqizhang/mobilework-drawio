# org-aware-dashboard-downloads — Every workspace member downloads the preconfigured desktop app

Daytona validation uses a single-org Acme deployment and a standard Windows desktop artifact mounted through `OPENWORK_INSTALLER_ARTIFACTS_DIR`. The preferred path remains organization-configured and does not require public download egress. If Den cannot prepare that artifact in a GitHub-enabled deployment, it verifies the normal versioned DMG or EXE before redirecting the browser; if that verification also fails, it uses the stable OpenWork download page instead of exposing an infrastructure error or a guessed URL.

1. Alex opens Acme’s admin dashboard. The download card now sets up OpenWork for Acme instead of offering anonymous files from public releases.

2. Alex chooses Download for this workspace and arrives on Acme’s install page, where the workspace and required sign-in are clear.

3. Riley signs in as an ordinary member and sees the same download action without any administrative distribution controls.

4. Riley opens it and receives Acme’s configured Windows or Mac installer from Acme’s OpenWork server.

5. Alex copies the team link twice. The original link remains valid, so later copies cannot break links already distributed.

6. Possessing the installer still grants no workspace access; Riley must sign in normally.
